        Origami Instruction and Diagrams

        <h3><br>
            What can you make by folding a piece of paper- a boat, a swan, an aero plane?
             This art of paper folding is a form of Japanese art and is known as ‘Origami’. 
             In Japanese ‘Ori’ stands for ‘folding’ and ‘gami’ stands for ‘paper’.
             Origami is the art of folding paper into designs. 
             The Japanese Paper Crane is one of the more popular origami designs. 
             The word origami originates from two words ori meaning “folding” and kami meaning “paper.”
